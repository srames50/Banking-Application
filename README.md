# Banking Application

## Overview

Welcome to my Banking Application a project where I delved into the realms of handling banking transactions using queues and binary search trees. This project served as an opportunity to explore program and class design.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project were to:

- Gain practical experience with queues and binary search trees.
- Design a banking application capable of processing diverse transactions.

## Features

- **Transaction Processing:** The program reads transactions from a file, executes them in order, and prints open accounts with balances.
  
- **Transaction Types:**
  - Open an account
  - Deposit funds
  - Withdraw funds
  - Transfer funds
  - Display transaction history
  
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for semantic errors, ensuring smooth execution.

## Implementation

- **Client Accounts:** Modeled with two strings (first and last name) and a unique ID. Each account encompasses eight funds.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Utilized an STL queue for efficient transaction processing.
  - Employed a Binary Search Tree (BSTree) to manage client accounts.
